### 📁 Project Files Overview

In this folder, you will find the primary prototype files created using **KiCad 8**. These files can be used to generate the necessary **Gerber files** required for PCB manufacturing.

Additionally, the folder includes:

* 💡 **Digital circuit design source files** – Schematics and layouts for the digital components of the project.
* 🧪 **Testbenches** – Simulation files used to verify the behavior and performance of individual subcircuits.

These resources collectively support both the hardware prototyping and digital logic development aspects of the project.
